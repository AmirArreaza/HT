+ Tests compile and pass
+ Over-engineered: the most efforts were spent to accounts (Business & Personal, tests, etc.)
+ main task is implemented

- unused code or variables
- only a happy path is tested. No corner cases are tested.
- not good enough REST
        get("/Customers", (req, res) -> {....});
        get("/Customer/:id", (req, res) -> {.....}
- no thread safety for transfers
- no atomicity for transactions
